This term is called $NN$ because it can be a neural network. So overall a NODE problem is a data-driven method, that aims to model the solution $u(t)$ when the ODE can not be solved exactly, or even if $f$ is unknown. Let's look at the details with an example."

The definition of this grid also influences the definition of the force $f$, because usually the derivatives are approximated into finite differences.
