# Burgers equations with small scale

We start by defining the right-hand side of the Burgers equation. We will use the finite difference method to compute the spatial derivatives.
So the first step is to define the grid that we are going to use.
We define a DNS and a LES

```julia
import CoupledNODE: Grid
nux_dns = 1024
dux_dns = 2π / nux_dns
grid_u_dns = Grid(dim = 1, dx = dux_dns, nx = nux_dns)
nux_les = 32
dux_les = 2π / nux_les
grid_u_les = Grid(dim = 1, dx = dux_les, nx = nux_les)
```

Construct the right-hand side of the Burgers equation

```julia
include("./../../src/Burgers.jl")
ν = 0.001f0
force_params = (ν,)
grid_B_dns = (grid_u_dns,)
grid_B_les = (grid_u_les,)
F_dns = create_burgers_rhs(grid_B_dns, force_params)
F_les = create_burgers_rhs(grid_B_les, force_params)
```

and generate some initial conditions

```julia
u0_dns = generate_initial_conditions(grid_B_dns[1].nx, 1);
```

Set the kernel size and get the gaussian filter

```julia
ΔΦ = 5 * grid_B_les[1].dx
Φ = create_filter_matrix(grid_B_les, grid_B_dns, ΔΦ, "hat")
Φ = create_filter_matrix(grid_B_les, grid_B_dns, ΔΦ, "gaussian")
```

Apply the filter to the initial condition

```julia
u0_les = Φ * u0_dns
```

### Subgrid scale (SGS)
The Subgrid scale (SGS) is defined as the difference between the DNS and the reconstructed LES.
Let's show an example of the SGS term for the Burgers equation:
To get the reconstruction operator I need the small cell volume ω and the large cell volume Ω (nha that is only for average)

```julia
ω = grid_B_dns[1].dx
Ω = grid_B_les[1].dx
R = 1 / ω * transpose(Φ) * Ω
```

Actually this is the correct way to construct the R operator

```julia
R = transpose(Φ) *inv(Matrix(Φ*transpose(Φ)))
```

is this the identity?

```julia
using LinearAlgebra
isapprox(R * Φ, Matrix(I, size(R * Φ)), atol = 1e-5)
isapprox(Φ * R, Matrix(I, size(Φ * R)), atol = 1e-5)
heatmap(R)
heatmap(Φ)
heatmap(Φ * R)
```

NOT ok! fix R

```julia
u0_rec = R * u0_les
sgs = u0_dns - u0_rec
using LaTeXStrings
plot(grid_B_dns[1].x, u0_dns, label = "u", title = "Subgrid scale (SGS)",
    xlabel = "x", ylabel = L"u", legend = :topleft)
plot!(grid_B_les[1].x, u0_les, label = L"\bar{u}=\mathbf{\Phi} u")
plot!(grid_B_dns[1].x, u0_rec, label = L"\mathbf{R} \bar{u}")
plot!(grid_B_dns[1].x, sgs, label = "SGS")
```

## Energy

PDEs like the Burgers equation conserve energy. If we discretize the Burgers equation the energy conservation takes the following form:
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dt} = \bm{u}^T \bm{\omega} f(\bm{u})
\end{equation}
$$
where $E$ is the energy of the system given by:
$$
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{2} \bm{u}^T \bm{\omega} \bm{u},
\end{equation}
$$
and $\bm{\omega} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ is the grid volumes of the diagonal elements.
In a dissipative system as Burgers equation, the energy will decrease over time, so the condition becomes actually
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dt} = \bm{u}^T \bm{\omega} f(\bm{u}) \le 0.
\end{equation}
$$

If we define our filtering operation to return the following sgs:
$$
\bm{u}' := \bm{u} - \bm{R} \bar{\bm{u}},
$$
then, the filtering transform the energy constraint as follows:
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dt} = \bar{\bm{u}}^T \bm{\Omega} \frac{d\bar{\bm{u}}}{dt} + \left( \bm{u}'\right)^T \bm{\omega} \frac{d\bm{u}'}{dt} \le 0,
\end{equation}
$$
where the energy is now decomposed as
$$
\begin{align}
E &=  \frac{1}{2} \bar{\bm{u}}^T \bm{\omega} \bar{\bm{u}} +\frac{1}{2} \left(\bm{u}'\right)^T \bm{\omega} \bm{u}'\\
&:= \bar{E} + E',
\end{align}
$$
which are the resovled and the sgs energy terms, respectively.

However, we do not want to handle the sgs term explicitly, because it lives on the fine grid. So instead we compress it using a linear filter $\bm{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ introducing
$$
\bm{s} = \bm{T} \bm{u}',
$$
which now represents the sgs as $\bm{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{M}$.

Then the energy conservation becomes
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dt} = \bar{\bm{u}}^T \bm{\Omega} \frac{d\bar{\bm{u}}}{dt} +  \bm{s}^T \bm{\Omega} \frac{d\bm{s}}{dt} \le 0,
\end{equation}
$$
where
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\bm{s}}{dt} = \bm{T} \frac{d\bm{u}'}{dt}.
\end{equation}
$$

### Plot the energy

```julia
import DiffEqFlux: NeuralODE
,("./../../src/NODE.jl")
f_dns = create_f_CNODE(create_burgers_rhs, force_params, grid_B_dns; is_closed = false);
using Random, LuxCUDA, Lux
Random.seed!(123)
rng = Random.default_rng()
θ_dns, st_dns = Lux.setup(rng, f_dns);
t_shock = 10.0f0
dt_dns = 0.001f0
trange_burn = (0.0f0, t_shock)
saveat_shock = 0.01f0
dns = NeuralODE(f_dns,
    trange_burn,
    solver_algo,
    adaptive = false,
    dt = dt_dns,
    saveat = saveat_shock);
u_dns = Array(dns(u0_dns, θ_dns, st_dns)[1]);
```

Drop sample dimension

```julia
u_dns = u_dns[:, 1, :]
u_filt = Φ * u_dns

E_dns = sum(u_dns .^ 2, dims=1) * grid_B_dns[1].dx / 2
E_filt = sum(u_filt .^ 2, dims=1) * grid_B_les[1].dx / 2

plot(E_dns[1, :], label = "DNS", title = "Energy",
    xlabel = "Time", ylabel = "Energy")
plot!(E_filt[1, :], label = "LES")
```
