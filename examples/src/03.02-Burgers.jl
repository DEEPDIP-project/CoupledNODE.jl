# # Burgers equations with small scale

# We start by defining the right-hand side of the Burgers equation. We will use the finite difference method to compute the spatial derivatives. 
# So the first step is to define the grid that we are going to use.
# We define a DNS and a LES

nux_les = 32
dux_les = 2π / nux_les
grid_u_les = Grid(dim = 1, dx = dux_les, nx = nux_les)

# Set the kernel size and get the gaussian filter
ΔΦ = 5 * grid_B_les[1].dx
Φ = create_filter_matrix(grid_B_les, grid_B_dns, ΔΦ, "gaussian")

# ## Energy

# PDEs like the Burgers equation conserve energy. If we discretize the Burgers equation the energy conservation takes the following form:
# $$
# \begin{equation}
# \frac{dE}{dt} = \bm{u}^T \bm{\omega} f(\bm{u}) 
# \end{equation}
# $$
# where $E$ is the energy of the system given by:
# $$
# \begin{equation}
# E = \frac{1}{2} \bm{u}^T \bm{\omega} \bm{u},
# \end{equation}
# $$
# and $\bm{\omega} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ is the grid volumes of the diagonal elements.
# In a dissipative system as Burgers equation, the energy will decrease over time. We can compute the energy of the system at each time step and plot it to verify that the energy is decreasing.
